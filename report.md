Prevalence in Australia 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (2024) reports that 47,216 divorces were granted in 2024, with a divorce rate of 2.1 per 1,000 residents. Although this number is slightly lower than the 48,700 divorces recorded in 2023, the impact on school-aged children remains significant (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2024).
For the education sector, around 47% of these divorces involved children under 18 (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2025). However, the divorce statistics underestimates the true scale of family breakdown within school communities. When the dissolution of de facto and unregistered relationships is considered, it is estimated that approximately one in five children is impacted by parental separation before the age of 18 (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025)
Furthermore, the temporal trends of separation are particularly relevant for secondary educators. While the median duration from marriage to divorce in Australia is 13.2 years, the median duration to final separation is shorter, at approximately 9 years (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2024; Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2025). This indicates a gap of 3–4 years between the breakdown of the relationship and the legal finalisation of divorce (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2025)
Consequently, secondary students may be navigating the cumulative impact of a separation that occurred during their primary years, or the stress of legal proceedings finalising as they enter adolescence (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2025). 
This period also aligns with a time of higher neurobiological vulnerability. Research shows that adolescents aged 15–17 have higher levels of distress during routine separation (21%) compared with younger groups, based on parent reports (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2020). 
Health professionals also report more concerns about the wellbeing of 15–17-year-olds than other children (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2020). Because of this, secondary schools become an important place where the complex impacts of family breakdown appear.
Characteristics and Indicators of Adversity
Identifying students who are experiencing family breakdown can be difficult for teachers because the signs of distress often look similar to normal adolescent behaviour (Clark, 2023). 
However, some indicators appear more clearly in secondary schools, especially school refusal. School refusal is different from truancy. Truancy usually involves hiding absences from parents, while school refusal involves strong emotional distress about going to school, and parents know about the absence and have tried to help the student attend. Separation and divorce are important contributing factors to this behaviour (Clark, 2023).
This problem can become worse when students have to move between two households. The logistics and emotional challenges can disturb the stability they need for regular attendance (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
In the classroom, high-conflict divorce often shows clear changes in student behaviour. Secondary teachers notice students who were once engaged becoming withdrawn. They may miss assessment deadlines and show poor concentration. This is because of the "all-encompassing underlying stress" from home (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
Some students may show externalising behaviours like defiance or aggression, reflecting the conflict they see at home. Others show internalising symptoms, such as high anxiety, especially on days when custody changes happen (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
Impact on Development, Learning, and Neurobiology
The impact of family breakdown on adolescents goes beyond immediate behaviours. It can fundamentally alter neurobiological development and cognitive functioning. Adolescence is a critical period of neuroplasticity where the brain is highly sensitive to environmental influences such as parenting (Orygen, 2025). 
However, this period is also characterised by significant structural remodeling, specifically an imbalance between the developing limbic system and the still-maturing prefrontal cortex (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
This neurological state makes students acutely sensitive to environmental stressors. Evidence suggests that the adolescent stress-response involves an increased secretion of cortisol, and prolonged exposure to family conflict can lead to sustained cortisol secretion, which is a neurobiological marker for depression and other psychological dysfunctions (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025). Consequently, chronic adversity can disrupt the prefrontal cortex—the area controlling executive functions such as impulse control, planning, and emotional regulation which reduces a student’s capacity to engage academically (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
There is a clear link between parents’ emotional states and adolescents’ brain responses. Turpyn et al. (2017) found that higher levels of parental negative emotion are linked to increased activation of the adolescent amygdala, the brain’s threat detection centre, when adolescents are exposed to negative stimuli. 
Importantly, this effect depends on how well parents regulate their own emotions. When parents struggle with emotion regulation, adolescents show increased activity not only in the amygdala but also in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Turpyn et al., 2017). This higher vmPFC activity does not mean adolescents are unregulated; instead, it reflects over-engagement of regulatory resources as they try to manage intense emotional arousal (Turpyn et al., 2017). Over time, this constant neural effort can exhaust their regulatory capacity, leaving adolescents biologically “primed” to detect threats and reducing the cognitive resources available for learning (Turpyn et al., 2017).
This neurobiological change affects educational outcomes. The mental effort needed to manage this heightened arousal uses resources required for complex academic tasks. 
Therefore, deficits in executive function caused by family stress can be misunderstood by educators as lack of motivation or ability, instead of a physiological response to trauma. Without proper intervention, these cognitive challenges can lead to academic failure, higher risk of early school leaving, and long-term educational disadvantage (Clark, 2023).
Impact on Students with Special Needs (ASD/ADHD)
The negative effects of family breakdown are more significant for students with special educational needs, especially those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Clark, 2023; Hetherington, 2017).
For students with ASD, having predictable routines is important for emotional regulation, but parental separation often brings changes in households and unpredictable schedules, disrupting these routines (Hetherington, 2017). As a result, students may show more self-stimulatory behaviours, sensory seeking, or withdrawal (Hetherington, 2017). Importantly, these behaviours are not just disruptive. They often help students cope with the disruption and should not be discouraged without first providing alternative ways to regulate emotions (Hetherington, 2017).
The challenges of living between two households create particular risks for neurodiverse students, as inconsistencies in routines and sensory environments can trigger anxiety and overload (Hetherington, 2017). Schools try to address this through “reasonable adjustments,” but recent research shows that these adjustments only work well when there is strong collaboration in the “Communication between Parent-Teacher-Child” domain (Page et al., 2024). 
In high-conflict divorces, this communication often breaks down, leading to what teachers call “communication uncertainty” (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025). Teachers frequently face unclear situations about which parents can make key decisions, such as regarding medication or Individualised Education Plans (IEPs), causing delays or loss of essential support (Podwinski & Laletas, 2025). As a result, failures in parental communication move beyond a private family issue and become a systemic barrier that hinders the student’s access to fair education and academic success (Page et al., 2024; Podwinski & Laletas, 2025).
Reflection: My Role as an Educator
Whole-School and Pedagogical Approaches
To reduce the negative effects of family breakdown, secondary schools need to go beyond reactive discipline and adopt proactive, trauma-informed teaching approaches. The Berry Street Education Model (BSEM) provides a framework for students who may be disengaged or disruptive due to trauma, supporting them to “heal first, then thrive” (Bailey & Brunzell, 2019). The model’s first domains, “Body” and “Relationship,” help students build physical regulation and relational safety, while “Stamina” and “Engagement” are especially important for secondary students dealing with family conflict (Bailey & Brunzell, 2019). Family breakdown often drains students’ emotional energy, so the “Stamina” domain focuses on resilience and emotional intelligence to support academic persistence. The “Engagement” domain provides strategies for students who have withdrawn psychologically, helping them stay motivated despite challenges at home (Bailey & Brunzell, 2019).
Since I do not have teaching experience, I reflect based on my own high school experience. I remember a close friend from a single-parent household who often skipped class and got into fights. His father was mostly absent, and his mother cared for him alone. At the time, he was labelled a “troublemaker,” but now I see that his behaviour may have been an emotional outlet for the stress and instability he faced. He was not acting out to be difficult; he was struggling to regulate his emotions.
Classroom Practice and Reasonable Adjustments
For students with special needs experiencing family separation, teaching strategies must be translated into practical “reasonable adjustments” to ensure fair access to education (Page et al., 2024). Research shows that schools often apply these adjustments reactively, but supporting students effectively requires proactive measures to reduce logistical challenges across households (Mavropoulou et al., 2021, as cited in Page et al., 2024). For example, providing duplicate textbooks or digital licenses can prevent anxiety when materials are forgotten during custody transitions. Students with ASD, who find dual-household living unpredictable, benefit from enhanced visual schedules, such as interactive magnetic routine charts, to map custody arrangements and reduce uncertainty (Hetherington, 2017). Teacher aides are also important for helping students remain included and maintain continuity in the classroom (Page et al., 2024).
In my future classroom, I will try to ensure no student feels “less than” because of their family situation. I will provide necessary materials, so students do not need to bring things from home or prepare themselves which can help prevent inequality, comparison, and shame.
Parent Partnerships and Legal Obligations
Supporting students affected by family breakdown requires managing complex and sometimes adversarial parental relationships while strictly following legal requirements. Educators must remain neutral, keeping the school a “demilitarized” safe space rather than a place to resolve family conflicts (NSW Government, 2021). Legally, unless a court order says otherwise, both parents usually share parental responsibility. This means non-residential parents generally have the right to attend school events and receive documents like school reports, a detail often misunderstood in high-conflict situations (NSW Government, 2021).
We also face “grey areas” when third parties are involved. For example, step-parents collecting a child from school need explicit consent from the biological parent, adding complexity to communication (NSW Government, 2021; Podwinski & Laletas, 2025). Finally, while schools do not enforce Family Court orders, we must check the terms of any Apprehended Violence Orders (AVOs) to protect student safety. At the same time, we must balance confidentiality with the duty to support distressed students (NSW Government, 2021).
Connecting to Community Support
I understand my limits as an educator. I do not have the ability to fix a student’s home life or act as a therapist. My role is to act as a bridge. When a student’s needs go beyond what I can manage, such as severe anxiety or safety concerns. I will report the case to the school student wellbeing team, the Principal etc.
